# Completion Summary: bootstrap-firehose

## What Changed
- Created and standardized the Firehose documentation workspace under `.docs/` with `todo`, `doing`, and `done` directories.
- Added starter Firehose artifacts (`proposal.md`, `spec.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) for bootstrap and established `.docs/PRD.md` as the project context entry point.
- Replaced initial PRD placeholders with project-specific digest goals, pipeline scope, and delivery requirements.

## Verification
- Verified `.docs/` structure and artifact presence.
- Verified `.docs/PRD.md` includes goals, non-goals, and workflow context.
