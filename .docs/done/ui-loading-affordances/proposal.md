# Proposal: UI Loading Affordances

## Why
The redesigned console retained functionality, but some action loading feedback became less visible compared with earlier behavior.

## Scope
- Restore explicit loading visibility for common actions in the new UI.
- Add a global in-progress banner with contextual text.
- Reintroduce action-level button loading labels/icons where operators expect them.

## Non-goals
- No backend API changes.
- No change to action semantics.
