# Proposal: Admin Review Diff UX

## Why
Operators reported the Review tab appears non-functional because the diff panel often shows `{}` without clear explanation.

## Scope
- Add a live local diff view that updates as profile editor content changes.
- Clarify server diff behavior and empty states.
- Add JSON validity feedback in the Review tab and guard actions when invalid.

## Out of Scope
- Backend API contract changes for profile diff.
- Per-field visual diff widgets.
