- [x] 2.1 Add profile config for quality repair and learning controls.
- [x] 2.2 Add runtime quality judge + conditional repair integration.
- [x] 2.3 Add section rebuild logic preserving limits and uniqueness.

- [x] 3.1 Add persistence for quality eval records.
- [x] 3.2 Add persistence for quality priors and bounded updates.
- [x] 3.3 Apply decayed priors and feedback bias in ranking.

- [x] 4.1 Add tests for online repair applied/skipped behavior.
- [x] 4.2 Add tests for cross-run learning impact on ranking.

- [x] 5.1 Update profile defaults and README docs.
- [x] 5.2 Run full test suite and confirm no regressions.
