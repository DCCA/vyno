# Design: Bootstrap Firehose Workflow

## Approach
Create the minimal folder and file structure directly in the repository to satisfy Firehose conventions.

## Tradeoffs
- Pros: Immediate standardization and low setup cost.
- Cons: Placeholder content requires follow-up to become project-specific.

## Risks
- Drift if contributors do not maintain artifacts.
