# Proposal: digest-context-feedback

## Why
Quality-first filtering is working, but users need explicit context in the digest itself to understand why a run may be sparse.

## Scope
- Add contextual run feedback to digest outputs (Obsidian + Telegram).
- Include funnel counts (fetched, filtered, selected) and sparse-run explanation.
- Keep ranking/filtering policies unchanged.

## Out of scope
- Relaxing quality gates.
- Backfilling low-signal content.
